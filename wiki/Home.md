Welcome to the `tivars_lib_py` wiki. Please don't mind the mess while things are getting set up.

This wiki contains documentation for the file formats utilized by TI for its various variable types, as compiled from

- documentation sites such as the [TI-83 Link Guide](http://merthsoft.com/linkguide/ti83+/vars.html) and [WikiTI](https://wikiti.brandonw.net/index.php?title=WikiTI_Home),
- library implementations such as those found here and in [`tivars_lib_cpp`](https://github.com/adriweb/tivars_lib_cpp),
- and a disturbingly high number of personal communications and undocumented sprees of reverse-engineering.

While this wiki is kept in the `tivars_lib_py` repository, the vast majority of information is agnostic to the library itself. We aim to make information about the file formats easy to access and understand, without it being coupled to potentially cryptic code or older, obscure sources. If you'd like to make a contribution, please open a PR for your edit in the `tivars_lib_py/wiki` directory.
